description: Normally I'm not your typical street photographer. But when you're strolling through Kathmandu these photos just come natural. It is definitely one of the most vibrant places I visited in my life. From the moment you leave the airplane it feels like visiting a totally different planet full of crazy traffic, colorful busy streets and the best restaurant of the solar system (just look for Tulsi Veg Restaurant).
