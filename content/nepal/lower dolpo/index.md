description: If your goal is to get away from civilization as far as possible the Lower Dolpo area is a pretty good choice. I joined a group of super adventurous people and enjoyed two weeks of wonderful landscape, altitude sickness and a way too heavy backpack. Photography was not the main theme of this trip but I think got some good shoots nevertheless.
