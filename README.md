# Welcome to my little hideout

I'm just a tech nerd and casual photographer who tries building his own funny Hugo homepage.
As a theme I'm using the great gallery theme by Nico Kaiser, which I try to adapt to my own needs.

At the moment it might look like a construction site, but maybe there are some gems to explore.
